/*
Problem - the top most comment is using double backslash(line comment) instead of paragraph comment(/*), another comment is incorrectly making a paragraph comment, console.log is spelled wrong and the string within the console.log is missing a single quote at the end of the sentence.
Solution - changed line comment to paragraph comment, edited paragraph comment correctly, correctly spelled console.log and added single qoute at the end of the sentence.
Why - having proper syntax is important for both line and paragraph comments, functions can only work if they called correctly, that includes spelling and in order for a string to end there must be a qoutation mark at the start and begining of the sentence.
Others - ?.
