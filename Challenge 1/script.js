/* This is the firstname of the user */

const user = 'John'


/* This is the lastname of the user */ const surname = 'Smith'


console.log(user, surname)

/*
Problem - paragraph comment done incorrectly and variables within console.log is seperated by semi-colons.
Solution - corrected comments syntax and seperated variables by commas.
Why - the correct syntax of paragraph comments must be followed to work and the only way to seperate variables within a single console.log is using a comma.
Others - I could have done the comment via two backslashes and seperated the variables into to console.log.
